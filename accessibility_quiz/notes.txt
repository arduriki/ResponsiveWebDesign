SVG Images:
A useful property of an SVG (scalable vector graphics) is that it contains a path attribute which allows the image to be scaled without affecting the resolution of the resultant image.

Currently, the img is assuming its default size, which is too large. CSS has a max function which returns the largest of a set of comma-separated values. For example:

img {
  width: max(250px, 25vw);
}
In this example, img elements will have a minimum width of 250px. And as the viewport grows, the image will grow accordingly to be 25 percent of the viewport width.

The child combinator selector > is used between selectors to target only elements that match the second selector and are a direct child of the first selector.

This can be helpful when you have deeply nested elements and want to control the scope of your styling.

To increase the page accessibility, the role attribute can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element on the page to assistive technologies. The role attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), and accepts preset values.

Every region role requires a label, which helps screen reader users understand the purpose of the region. One method for adding a label is to add a heading element inside the region and then reference it with the aria-labelledby attribute.

Typeface plays an important role in the accessibility of a page. Some fonts are easier to read than others, and this is especially true on low-resolution screens.
